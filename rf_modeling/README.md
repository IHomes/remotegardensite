#RF Modeling
For long distance communications systems RF Modeling can help determine if communications are possible.


## Splat
An open source linux/windows utility (  Signal Propagation, Loss, And Terrain analysis tool). This tool seems to have the right balance of features, usability and cost (free).

Ref:  http://www.qsl.net/kd2bd/splat.html

I have included some example files used to run the tool as well as the output of my initial analysis of my dnt900 communications system. Not a perfect model, but gave me some hope my remote and base station could establish comms.
